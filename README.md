List of third-party libraries:

1 Alamofire: To process network requests. Always up-to-date, used by many big-name companies. There are caching functions. Handy documentation. There are many simple calls to execute and process the required requests.

2 SwiftyJSON: In my opinion, the best solution for all kinds of JSON response from the server. Simple library. Usable. Always updated. The developers are great.

3 SDWebImage + SDWebImageSwiftUI: One of the best solutions to reverse photos from the web. It has many additional features, such as photo caching with an initiated disk in the device's memory and a conveniently configurable size of the allowed cache. It also has the necessary display elements, such as the Activity Indicator and PlaceHolder.
